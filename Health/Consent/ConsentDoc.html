  <b> eWellness Study Consent Form</b>

  <p> Dr. Majid Sarrafzadeh, from the Computer Science Department at the
    University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
  </p>

  <p>You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a
    current student, employee or affiliate of the university. Your participation
    in this research study is voluntary.</p>

  <b>Why is this study being done?</b>

  <p>This study aims to determine if data that can be collected passively off
    your
    phone, can be predictive of your mental wellness at a given time.
    This data is limited to embedded sensors like GPS, light, and accelerometer,
    and will not collect any personally identifiable information on you. Our
    eventual hope is to create a platform that can predict if a person is in
    crises and direct help to them without them needing to actively seek out
    help. </p>

  <b>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</b>

  </p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you
  to do the following:

  <ul>
    <li>Fill out a survey consisting of 24 multiple-choice questions once a week
      for the duration of the study</li>
    <li>Fill out a small daily questionnaire of 10 multiple-choice questions.
    </li>
    <li> Install the app and have it running on your phone in the background
      throughout the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>How long will I be in the research study?</b>

  <p>
    Participation will take a total of about 1 hour spread over the course of a
    monthâ€™s time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only time requirements for the study will be installing the application,
    and
    taking the surveys.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is anticipated that the weekly survey will take no more than 5 minutes,
    and
    the daily survey no more than 1 minute.
  </p>

  <b>Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this
    study?</b>

  <ul>
    <li>Running a mobile application in the background may negatively impact the
      battery life and performance of the phone. We have taken steps to diminish
      the
      impact of the application, but some degradation is expected.</li>
    <li>While the questionnaires are minimally intrusive, it is possible that
      probing
      your mental wellness state may engender some discomfort or unease. Please
      immediately discontinue the study if you feel the questioning to be
      discomforting.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</b>

  <p>
    You may benefit from the study by becoming more aware of daily stressors and
    being more mindful of your mental state.
  </p>

  <p>
    The results of the research may be included in future grant proposals or
    research publications. None of your specific data will be included in any
    public
    disclosure.
  </p>

  <b>What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</b>

  <p>
    As a student or university affiliate, your participation in this study will
    be
    entirely voluntary.
  </p>

  <b>Will I be paid for participating?</b>

  <p>
    You will receive an Amazon gift card for the successful participation in the
    survey. This will require your active participation throughout the data
    collection process. The precise amount offered will be dependent on the
    duration
    and consistency of involvement. Failure to remain actively engaged in the
    study
    may result in forfeiture of the gift card.
  </p>

  <b>Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</b>

  <p>
    Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can
    identify you will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your
    permission or as required by law. Confidentiality will be maintained by
    limiting
    collection solely to non-identifiable data. All collected data will be
    stored
    on
    a secure fully encrypted server, and will only be made available to research
    study investigators.
  </p>

  <p>
    The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private
    information
    is
    kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially
    as
    possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and
    the
    potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and
    electronically secured. As with any use of electronic means to store data,
    there
    is a risk of breach of data security.
  </p>

  <p>
    No identifiable information about you will be kept with the research data.
    All
    research data and records will be maintained in a secure location at UCLA.
    Only
    authorized individuals will have access to it. The research team, authorized
    UCLA personnel and regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug
    Administration
    (FDA), may have access to study data and records to monitor the study.
    Research
    records provided to authorized, non-UCLA personnel will not contain
    identifiable
    information about you. Publications and/or presentations that result from
    this
    study will not identify you by name. The researchers intend to keep the
    research
    data and records indefinitely for future research.
  </p>

  <b>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</b>

    <li>You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may
      withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.</li>
    <li>Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss
      of
      benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.</li>
