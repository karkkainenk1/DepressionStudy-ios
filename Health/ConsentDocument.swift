    <body>
      <b> eWellness Study Consent Form</b>

      <p> Dr. Majid Sarrafzadeh, from the Computer Science Department at the
        University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
      </p>

      <p>You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a
        current student, employee or affiliate of the university. Your participation
        in this research study is voluntary.</p>

      <b>Why is this study being done?</b>

      <p>This study aims to determine if data that can be collected passively off
        your
        phone, can be predictive of your mental wellness at a given time.
        This data is limited to embedded sensors like GPS, light, and accelerometer,
        and will not collect any personally identifiable information on you. Our
        eventual hope is to create a platform that can predict if a person is in
        crises and direct help to them without them needing to actively seek out
        help. </p>

      <b>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</b>

      </p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you
      to do the following:

      <ul>
        <li>Fill out a survey consisting of 24 multiple-choice questions once a week
          for the duration of the study</li>
        <li>Fill out a small daily questionnaire of 10 multiple-choice questions.
        </li>
        <li> Install the app and have it running on your phone in the background
          throughout the day.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>How long will I be in the research study?</b>

      <p>
        Participation will take a total of about 1 hour spread over the course of a
        monthâ€™s time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only time requirements for the study will be installing the application,
        and
        taking the surveys.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is anticipated that the weekly survey will take no more than 5 minutes,
        and
        the daily survey no more than 1 minute.
      </p>

      <b>Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this
        study?</b>

      <ul>
        <li>Running a mobile application in the background may negatively impact the
          battery life and performance of the phone. We have taken steps to diminish
          the
          impact of the application, but some degradation is expected.</li>
        <li>While the questionnaires are minimally intrusive, it is possible that
          probing
          your mental wellness state may engender some discomfort or unease. Please
          immediately discontinue the study if you feel the questioning to be
          discomforting.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</b>

      <p>
        You may benefit from the study by becoming more aware of daily stressors and
        being more mindful of your mental state.
      </p>

      <p>
        The results of the research may be included in future grant proposals or
        research publications. None of your specific data will be included in any
        public
        disclosure.
      </p>

      <b>What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</b>

      <p>
        As a student or university affiliate, your participation in this study will
        be
        entirely voluntary.
      </p>

      <b>Will I be paid for participating?</b>

      <p>
        You will receive an Amazon gift card for the successful participation in the
        survey. This will require your active participation throughout the data
        collection process. The precise amount offered will be dependent on the
        duration
        and consistency of involvement. Failure to remain actively engaged in the
        study
        may result in forfeiture of the gift card.
      </p>

      <b>Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</b>

      <p>
        Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can
        identify you will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your
        permission or as required by law. Confidentiality will be maintained by
        limiting
        collection solely to non-identifiable data. All collected data will be
        stored
        on
        a secure fully encrypted server, and will only be made available to research
        study investigators.
      </p>

      <p>
        The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private
        information
        is
        kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially
        as
        possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and
        the
        potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and
        electronically secured. As with any use of electronic means to store data,
        there
        is a risk of breach of data security.
      </p>

      <p>
        No identifiable information about you will be kept with the research data.
        All
        research data and records will be maintained in a secure location at UCLA.
        Only
        authorized individuals will have access to it. The research team, authorized
        UCLA personnel and regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug
        Administration
        (FDA), may have access to study data and records to monitor the study.
        Research
        records provided to authorized, non-UCLA personnel will not contain
        identifiable
        information about you. Publications and/or presentations that result from
        this
        study will not identify you by name. The researchers intend to keep the
        research
        data and records indefinitely for future research.
      </p>

      <b>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</b>

      <ul>
        <li>You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may
          withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.</li>
        <li>Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss
          of
          benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.</li>
        <li> You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer
          and
          still remain in the study.</li>
      </ul>
